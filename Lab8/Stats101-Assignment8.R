### Assignment #8


### Question 1
### Using a dependent t-test, is the difference between pre and post-test scores significant?


### Question 2
### Create subsets for each training condition. Which group shows no difference between pre and post-test scores?


### Question 3
### Which training group shows the largest effect size for the difference pre-test to post-test?


### Question 4
### Reshape the data into a wide format, and create a new variable for gain score. 
### Now subset the new dataframe based on the training conditions. Which comparison 
### between training conditions does not show a significant difference?


### Question 5
### To compare the gain scores across all groups, we now turn to ANOVA. Is the homogeneity of 
### variance assumption violated?


### Question 6
### Run an ANOVA model on the gain scores as a function of training condition. Is the effect of condition significant?\


### Question 7
### What is the corresponding eta-squared value? (round to 2 decimal places)


### Question 8
### Are the eta-squared and partial eta-squared value different in this case?


### Question 9
### Let's now run post-hoc comparisons (Tukey HSD). Which two groups do not significantly 
### differ from one another when considering gain scores?


### Question 10
### Based on these data, which training condition should you choose to target some improvements in spatial reasoning?
