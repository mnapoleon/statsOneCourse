### Assignment # 11


### Question 1
###Using a t-test, compare verbal scores before and after training in the fixed condition. 
### Is the difference pre-test to post-test significant?


### Question 2
### What are the degrees of freedom for the comparison between pre-test and post-test for the spatial scores?


### Question 3
### Run a Wilcoxon test for the same comparison (pre-test to post-test on spatial scores, fixed condition). 
### Which of the two tests gives the highest p-value for the comparison?


### Question 4
### What is the effect size (Cohen's d) for the difference between pre-test and post-test spatial scores 
### for the malleable condition? (round to two decimal places)


### Question 5
### Which of the three tasks shows the largest improvements from pre-test to post-test, in the fixed condition?


### Question 6
### Which of the three tasks shows the largest improvements from pre-test to post-test, in the malleable condition?


### Question 7
### Conduct Mann-Whitney comparisons between all tasks at pre-test. Which task(s) differ significantly 
### from the other two in pre-test scores?


### Question 8
### Which feedback condition led to the largest improvements overall?


### Question 9
### Which task is largely driving this effect?


### Question 10
### Based on the present data, are you convinced that malleable feedback is beneficial to performance 
### when engaging in a cognitive training program?
