### Assignment #5

### Question 1
### Run a regression model with salary as the outcome variable and years of experience as the predictor variable. 
### What is the 95% confidence interval for the regression coefficient? Type your answer exactly as it appears 
### in R but include only two decimal places (for example, if the 95% confidence interval is -1 to +1 then type -1.00 1.00)


### Question 2
### Run a regression model with salary as the outcome variable and courses as the predictor variable.
### What is the 95% confidence interval for the regression coefficient?


### Question 3
### Run a multiple regression model with both predictors and compare it with both the model from Question 1 
### and the model from Question 2. Is the model with both predictors significantly better than:


### Question 4
### Run a standardized multiple regression model with both predictors. Do the confidence interval values 
### differ from the corresponding unstandardized model?


### Question 5
### What function could you use to take a random subset of the data?


### Question 6
### Run the following command in R: set.seed(1). Now take a random subset of the original data so 
### that N=15. Is the correlation coefficient between salary and years of experience in this sample higher or 
### lower than in the whole data set?


### Question 7
### Take a subset of the original data from row 51 to 70. What is the percentage of variance explained by 
### a multiple regression model with both predictors (Provide your result with no decimal place)


### Question 8
### Using model comparison, which model provides the best fit for the subsetted data from Question 7?


### Question 9
### What is the correlation between the salary values predicted by the multiple regression model 
### and the actual salary scores in the subsetted data? (Provide your result rounded to 2 decimal places)


### Question 10
### Compute the correlation between the scores predicted by the multiple regression model 
### and the residuals from the same model. Is the correlation statistically significant?
